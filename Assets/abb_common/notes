managed to launch irb120 model w/ launch file here.

HOWEVER, arm is severed btwn links 3 and 4 in Gazebo model!!

need to fix this. 

also, rosrun abb_pub_base abb_pub_base to force the robot-arm base to a fixed pose on the ground plane.
(included this node in the launch file) 

robot launches OK in Gazebo, then the links fall apart!  (more links are dying)

changed to URDF and meshes found here:

https://github.com/ros-industrial/abb_experimental
(put previous version in urdf_old and meshes_old)

edited the urdf (renamed urdf.xacro)
and changed directory references to abb_common/...
edited launch file

spawn model w/ launch file; 
looks beautiful in rviz (orange now)
But NOTHING in gazebo!

-----added inertias to newer urdf;
tried spawning manually:

wyatt@Wall-E:~/ros_workspace/cwru-ros-pkg-hydro/catkin/src/cwru_376_student/abb_common/urdf$ rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -urdf -file irb120.urdf -model abbyArm
spawn_model script started

Gazebo says there is a model "abbyArm", but it is only a "default" (no links)

tried this with urdf_old:  abbyArm in Gazebo DOES show 6 links and 6 joints (but still no visualization)
(formerly, at least, did see broken robot arm---now, nothing)
Also, rviz model is totally screwed--links embedded in each other
